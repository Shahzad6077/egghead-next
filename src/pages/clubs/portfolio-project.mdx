## Can you prove that you know what you know?

Whether you're looking for your first job or to further your career as an individual contributor, you need to prove you know what you know.

You need to _show_, not just _tell_.

Putting words like "React" or "AWS" in your resume and social media profiles will get you noticed, but it doesn't necessarily translate into getting you where you want to be.

You need to build your developer portfolio.

## It's bigger than writing code.

It's not just the code in your GitHub repos. It's not just a blog of what you learn.

Your developer portfolio features one ore more case studies that show how you move from idea to execution, and how you solve challenges along the way.

## Ready to get started?

We've put together an email mini-series with action items that culminate in your own personal case study that shows everyone your skills, personality, and interests.

Follow the guide, and share what you build.

Prove your skills, and get where you want to be.
